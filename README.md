# Project Summary
The Corner Grocer project provides a program that analyzes item purchase records. It allows users to check individual item frequencies, see a complete list of all items and their purchase counts, and view a histogram of purchases. The program also backs up this data into a file for future reference. This project was created to help the Corner Grocer optimize store layout by tracking purchase trends.

# What did you do particularly well?
What I did particularly well was implementing the feature that enables user interaction for item tracking and frequency display. What I also did well was using maps to handle data storage and retrieval.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
One area for improvement is optimizing the histogram display. Currently, the histogram uses a simple text-based output with asterisks to represent purchase frequency, but I could enhance it by adding color-coded output or grouping items by categories for easier interpretation. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What I found challenging was learning to use Maps for frequency counting. Maps in C++ require precise syntax, and I had trouble correctly implementing them for dynamically updating item counts. I referred to section 11.4 in zyBooks, which covers Maps, and this allowed me to fix the issues

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills I developed here, particularly around data handling with Maps and file I/O in C++, will be beneficial for future projects, where these features are often required for efficient program management.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I ensured the programâ€™s maintainability by following industry standards, using clear naming conventions, and placing in-line comments throughout the code. This allows others to understand the code structure easily and make modifications as needed.
